# Custom PCB Design Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
I designed a custom PCB based on the RP2040 microcontroller using KiCad 9.0,
following the official RP2040 hardware design guidelines.This version includes
several enhancements to improve usability and protection:
- ESD protection on the USB interface
- SWD header for debugging
- Dedicated Boot and Reset push-buttons
